
To remap the keyboard keys we will require 

# to know which physical key on keyboard to remap  
= the physical key Number is denoted by the "Kxx" in the K-MAP file

# to provide the desired output/action for the key using its corresponding Hex code
= the hex codes for output/action is listed in the hex output file 

we take the keys K value and equal it to the hex value for the desired action 
a specific format must be followed for the mapping to be valid and recognised by the software in the config file

WHAT  NOW? 

Go to your keyboard softwares installation directory and look for the cfg.ini file 
if the file has the above format then you can proceed to modifying the file 
modify it according to the instuctions above as per your choice of keys and desired output
after edidting the mappings in the cgf.ini file apply it using the software provided
do take a backup of your stock cgf.ini in case u need to reset back to stock
-----------------------------------------------

APPLYING THE CONFIGS

these softwares are very generic and are mostly copy pasta of one another with few modifications across models
In these software we are looking for buttons "RESTORE" & "APPLY"

pressing 'APPLY'   will NOT apply the configs already made into the cgf.ini
pressing 'RESTORE' WILL restore the keyboard mappings using the cfg.ini mapping data 

after using RESTORE , you should have your mappings applied to your keyboard 


-----------------------------------------------

WHAT CAN GO WRONG?

well nothing critical to the point where the keyboard is just a brick, so chill { you are doing all these at your own risk btw, dont cry later }
if the mappings are not edited correctly or conflicts , sometimes for some weird reasons some keys may have null output ( logically sending no data, as if its dead)
if such things happen , restore the stock cfg.ini [ well if u didnt take a backup before hand dont worry , just reinstall the software , it comes with the stock cfg.ini]
replaced your frankenstein cfg.ini with the stock one and RESTORE using the software
using reset key combo{specific to each keyboard} will also restore the keyboard to stock condition { hold FN+ESC in case of redragon fizz k617}
