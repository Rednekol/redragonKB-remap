# redragonKB-remap
Remap Fn in Redragon keyboard (+ eyooso,cosmic byte,hk gaming,etc)
Guide on how to--
 --remap FN key to any key on the keyboard 
 --add additional FN layer keys
all the remapping modifications are made to the cfg.ini config file found in software installation folder to remap the keys
and are applied to the keyboard by using the software provided by Redragon/eyooso (k617\z-11 software are cross compatible)(z-11 software includes some bug fixes)
tested on Redragon Fizz K617
Remap changes are saved in the keyboard MCU thus works on hardware level and do not need to be reapplied

!!May need to include some addiotional changes/edit the file differntly for different KB vendors for remap to work but core logic to remapping is same
